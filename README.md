# bankloanprediction
This repo consists of basic artificial neural network model built using scikit-learn ML package. It gives basic knowledge of how we can build classification predictive analytics model using sklearn and test our model. This project also shows how to get optimal number of nodes for ANN models.

The Bank Loan Classification dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sriharipramod/bank-loan-classification).
